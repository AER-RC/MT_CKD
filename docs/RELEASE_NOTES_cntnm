MT_CKD_3.2

Date: August 2017

    - New self continnum coeffients in window regions for wavenumbers 
      greater than 2000 cm-1 were added and self continuum temperature 
      dependence from 1800-3500 cm-1 were updated 
      (E.J. Mlawer, M.J. Alvarado, K.E. Cady-Pereira)

MT_CKD_3.1

Date: July 2017 (not publicly released)

    - Collision-induced absorption in the oxygen A-band 
      was added (E.J. Mlawer, D. Gombos, V.H. Payne, B. Drouin,
      K.E. Cady-Pereira)

MT_CKD_3.0:

Date: November 2016

    - Includes modifications to H2O foreign continuum coefficients in the
      far-infrared based on the analysis of REFIR-PAD (Bianchini and Palchetti, 2008) 
      measurements taken at Cerro Toco, Chile, as part of the ARM RHUBC-II campaign and a 
      re-analysis of the AERI-ER measurements from the ARM NSA site (first analyzed 
      in Delamere et al.(2010)). The foreign continuum was also changed in the sub-
      millimeter and microwave as a result of the analysis of SAO FTS (Paine and Turner,
      2013) measurements taken during the RHUBC-II campaign, which led to modification 
      of the H2O self continuum in this region to maintain good agreement with the 
      microwave measurements analyzed in Payne et al. (2008 and 2011). (E.J. Mlawer, D.D. 
      Turner, S.N. Paine, V.H. Payne)                                               

MT_CKD_2.8:

Date: July 2016

    - A number of changes were made to continuum absorption involving 
      water vapor in the window past the H2O fundamental band.  Self 
      continuum coefficients were modified from 1880-2390 cm-1 to fix 
      issues in the CO fundamental region that were pointed out by 
      Alvarado et al. (2012). Foreign continuum coefficients from 
      1800-3000 cm-1 were modified to improve agreement with Baranov 
      and Lafferty (2012); in the 1900-2150 cm-1 region, attention 
      was also paid to IASI measurements (Alvarado et al., 2012). 
      Coefficients for N2-H2O relative efficiency from 2000-2900 cm-1 
      were determined from Baranov and Lafferty simultaneously with 
      the H2O foreign and self continuum coefficients in this 
      region (as described above).

    - In addition, foreign continuum coefficients at wavenumbers 
      greater than 4000 cm-1 were modified based on Baranov & 
      Lafferty (2012) and Mondelain et al. (2014) measurements.
      (E.J. Mlawer and M.J. Alvarado)

MT_CKD_2.7:

Date: February 2016

    - Added first overtone of the N2 collision induced fundamental. (E. J. Mlawer, D. Gombos)
 
    - Fixed bug in calculation of temperature analytic Jacobians. (E. J. Mlawer, K. E. Cady-Pereira)

MT_CKD_2.5.2:

Date: January 2011

    - Added ‘if’ tests needed for speed improvements in monortm (K. E. Cady-Pereira, E.J. Mlawer)

    - Other software updates include:
	* In N2 pure rotation band, fixed incorrect indexing related to contribution from N2-O2 
	(E.J. Mlawer, A.E. Lipton, V.H. Payne)
        * Increased number of output points in all continuum modules to prevent possible truncation at
	high wavenumber end (E.J. Mlawer, S.A. Clough, C.H. Kohler)
	* Near-IR O2 continuum modified to allow for calculations over domains greater than 2000 cm-1; 
	needed by standalone continuum code (E.J. Mlawer, P. Hedelt)
	* O2 fundamental modified to correct 5 cm-1 shift (E.J. Mlawer, S.A. Clough, C.H. Kohler)
	* Rayleigh is now computed for IAERSL=5 (E.J. Mlawer, K.E. Cady-Pereira)

    - Updated historical information (E.J. Mlawer, V.H. Payne)

    - Corrected coding issue related to pure water vapor atmospheres in stand-alone continuum model (E.J. Mlawer).

    - Modified directory structure for source codes, makefiles, and documentation.

    - Added makefile system to compile the stand-alone continuum model.  Includes new platforms such as Windows and capability to easily add new platforms.

MT_CKD_2.5.1 (AER Internal Release Only):

Date: May 2010

      - Variables added to physical constants common block (J. Delamere) only in contnm.f (cntnm_progr.f not updated)

MT_CKD_2.5:

Date: January 2010

MT_CKD_2.5 continuum modifications included in this release are based on analyses of 
IASI, AIRS, and AERI measurements in the region past the bandhead of the CO2 
v3 band (~2385 cm-1):

      - Introduction of temperature dependence of carbon dioxide continuum absorption 
      from 2386-2434 cm-1 from IASI measurements (E.J. Mlawer and V.H. Payne)

      - Modification of carbon dioxide continuum coefficients from 2000-3000 cm-1 from 
      IASI and AERI (from ARM) measurements (E.J. Mlawer, V.H. Payne, and M.W. Shephard)

      - Modification of water vapor self continuum coefficients from 2000-3200 cm-1 from 
      IASI and AIRS measurements; fit based on near-IR studies of Bicknell et al. (2006) and 
      Fulghum and Tilleman (1991) (E.J. Mlawer and V.H. Payne)
************************************************************************
MT_CKD_2.4:  

Date: June 2009

Modifications to the water vapor continuum arise from new analyses of ARM measurements in the 
microwave and far-IR regions (S.A. Clough, J. Delamere, V.H. Payne, E.J. Mlawer)

- Analyses of measurements in the microwave are based primarily on the two-channel MWR (23.8 and 31.4 GHz) at SGP, 
  with supporting evidence from 150 GHz MWRHF measurements during the COPS campaign and from 170 GHz GVRP 
  measurements at SGP (Payne et al., 2009).
- Measurements in the far-IR were from the AERI_ext at the NSA site, in the time surrounding and including 
  the RHUBC-I campaign (Delamere et al., 2009).

Fixed an issue with the water vapor Jacobians in which the analytic Jacobians were dependent on the starting 
wavenumber (MT_CKD_2.3). (K.E. Cady-Pereira and S. Tjemkes)

Solved the issue of N2 Jacobians being included in the Jacobians generated for other 
molecules (MT_CKD_2.2) (S.A. Clough and M.W. Shephard)

MT_CKD_1.2 includes a modification to the collision induced absorption by 
N2 in the 0-350 cm-1 regime, Boissoles et al. (2003).

The structure of cntnm_progr.f has been altered somewhat to ensure closer
correlation betweem this continuum program and the continuum used in lblrtm.
The actual continuum module, contnm.f, is introduced into the present program
with an include statement.  The contnm.f module is that archived with lblrtm.

************************************************************************
MT_CKD_1.1

Date: 6 August 2004


MT_CKD_1.1 represents a modification of MT_CKD_1.0 for which the foreign
water vapor continuum in the 250 - 550 cm-1 range have been modified to
provide results consistent with CKD_2.4.1 in this spectral region.

The input water vapor mixing ratio is now interpreted as the mixing ratio 
with respect to DRY air.

The name of the output files have been modified slightly to
WATER.coeff and CNTNM.optdpt 

************************************************************************
MT_CKD_1.0


Date: 11 February 2003

This is the initial release of the MT_CKD water vapor continuum and
represents the  first recomputation of the entire self and foreign
broadened continuum since the original model was developed in the 
1980s.  This version of the continuum is implemented in the line-by-line
model LBLRTM v7.0 and will be utilized in all related AER Radiative 
Transfer models.

The MT_CKD continuum is based on a new formulation: The self and foreign
continuum models are each based on the contributions from two components:
a collision induced component and a line shape component.  This change in
perspective has resulted from the difficulty in developing a line shape
model based on sound physics that explains the magnitude of the increased
absorption in the intermediate wing over that provided by the impact 
approximation.

These two components are applied consistently to all water vapor lines 
from the microwave to the visible, and the results summed to obtain self 
and foreign continuum coefficients from 0-20,000 cm-1.  Eight and seven 
parameters are needed to specify the two components for the self and 
foreign continua, respectively, which are sufficient to generate the 
entire continuum spectrum over this spectral domain.  The ratio of the 
self continuum at 296 K to that at 260 K has been kept the same as in the 
CKD model.  The only temperature dependence for the foreign continuum 
arises from the radiation term as with CKD.  The MT_CKD model as with CKD, 
should be regarded as a semi empirical model with strong constraints 
provided by the known physics.

The data that have been used to develop the new continuum model has come 
predominantly from spectral atmospheric measurements.  Only cases for which 
the characterization of the atmospheric state has been highly scrutinized 
have been used.  This new model has been developed by E.J. Mlawer, 
D.C. Tobin and S.A. Clough building on the original CKD formulation; hence 
the name MT_CKD.


For this release of the continuum model, the stand alone program, 

                  cntnm_progr.f      

is being provided. 

The driver for this program enables input of the follwing pat variables: 
pressure, temperature path length and water vapor volume mixing ratio.  
A negative value for the pressure provides a default result from 
0 - 5000 cm-1 with P = 1013 mb, T = 296 k,  X (path) = 1 cm and vmr_h2o = 0.01.

In addition to the original version of ckd_0, there are three archived versions 
of ckd available with the release dates indicated:

ckd_2.4.2     2002_01        $Revision: 5.17

ckd_2.4.1     2000_04        revision:  5.12

ckd_2.2.2     1999_06        revision:  3.12

ckd_2.2       1996_03        revision:  3.7

ckd_0         1989

These models with associated readme files are contained in the directories 
associated with the continuum.  Information on the nature of the modifications 
is contained in the respective readme files.  The continuum module and associated 
continuum program (_program_) are very similar except that the latter includes a 
driver and a small modification has been made in 'SUBROUTINE CONTNM' to provide 
the appropriate interface.  The main substance of the code are data statements 
which are not only identical between continuum module and program, but up to this 
point are similar between the three evolutionary versions of the CKD continnum models.

Remarks on implementing the stand alone program are contained in
comments in the main progam: 'drcntnm' (driver for continuum).  The
program provides the following output files:

WATER.COEF - the mt_ckd_# self and foreign broadened water continuum coefficients.

CNTNM.OPTDPT - continuum optical depths for the defined path.


******   It should be noted that the MT_CKD water vapor continuum model
******   spans the spectral domain from 0 - 20,000 cm-1 (inf - 500 nm).
